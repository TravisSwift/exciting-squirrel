# A One Page Responsive Web Site using HTML and CSS



## Project Notes
This was a fun project to practice HTML and CSS and build a responsive, mobile first web site.

What I learned from this project

* Practiced using codeing shortcuts to improve workflow
 - ul>ui*5>a to instantly create five unordered items at once
 - .class-name to quickly create classes
 - How and why to reset CSS values

 I had my aha-moment with utility and pseudo classes. Although I had used them before with Tailwind, I was always confused about exactly what a utility class and a pseudo class is.
